# currencyapp-cli

This is a simple app for working with currencies.
Here you can add/delete tickers, observe how currency changes.

Technologies used i:

1. Vue/vue-cli
2. tailwindCSS
3. WebSockets (RestApi in earlier stages)

What I've learned in the process of development:

1. basics of vue
2. How to work with api/ws
3. When we need to split some components/modules into smaller ones (actually, there are a few modules which can be splitted)
4. Practiced with local storage and URL

What I need to learn:

1. vue in-depth
2. Vuex/nuxt
3. JavaScript in-depth (during the project I sometimes caught myself that I have not enough knowledge of vanilla js)
